# The mysterious room
The mysterious room is a text-adventure game which uses a lot of guessing games and some riddles. 
It's an exciting game that you can play to challenge your self and see if you can make it to the end of the game!

  ### Features left to implement
  * When there is time I would like to add more rooms and a deeper story. 
  * I would also like to implement more try and except statements to make sure the game won't crash in case something I haven't thought of occures. At this point most of the choices are based on only if else statements which might become a problem in case bugs occure. 

  ## Testing
   * √ç have checked the code through the pep8 linter and it gets 7 warnings for too long lines.
        These lines are lines with long comparative expressions.
   * I have done manual testing for bugs. 
   * Tested in my local terminal and the Heroku terminal.

### Bugs 
  #### Solved bugs
   * I came across bugs where peices of text kept repeating through out the story. This was beacause I hadn't used break during a while loop. 
   #### Remaining bugs
   * No known remaining bugs. 

### Validator testing
   * PEP8
     * Seven warnings for too long lines.
